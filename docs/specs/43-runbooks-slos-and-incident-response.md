# Runbooks, SLOs, and Incident Response

## Operational runbooks
- Inbox scan and routing validation runbook
- Tool-health harvest runbook
- Validation + readiness promotion runbook

## SLO framework
- validation pass stability
- artifact freshness windows
- blocker precision and fail-loud correctness

## Incident classes
- Contract drift
- Runtime blocker regression
- Observability ingest degradation
- Evidence freshness breach

## Response policy
- Fail-loud, preserve lower truthful state, triad escalation for promotion-impacting incidents
